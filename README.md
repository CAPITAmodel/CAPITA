# CAPITA

CAPITA is the Commonwealthâ€™s general purpose static microsimulation model of the Australian Tax-and-Transfer System. Microsimulation models are a key tool used by Government to analyse the effect of major policy reforms on households. They carry out calculations on a collection of individual records and can aggregate the outcomes at the individual level to shed light on policy impacts for particular groups, or the whole population. They are especially useful for analysing the effects of policy where policies interact with each other and a diverse range of outcomes are experienced by individuals in differing circumstances.

To use CAPITA you will need to separately access the underlying software and data. CAPITA is coded using SAS software. The underlying data for the distributional version of CAPITA is the 2017-18 Survey of Income and Housing confidentialised unit record file (CURF) and the 2016 Census 1 per cent sample microdata, which are accessible through the ABS MicrodataDownload service. For detail on accessing ABS microdata download please visit the ABS website, or contact microdata.access@abs.gov.au.

We hope that you enjoy using this model and we just ask that you read the user licence agreement as you download. We are also keen to collaborate to enhance the model. We would therefore greatly appreciate if you let us know that you have downloaded the model via the CAPITA@treasury.gov.au email address. Pull requests are also welcome.
